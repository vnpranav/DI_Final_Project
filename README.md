# DI_Final_Project
Final project of full stack development bootcamp

Name of project : Electro-Noot
Context : Micro-electronics store and wep app

Scenario : As an electrical and electronics student, I've recently starting working on Arduino and Raspberry Pi projects. Hence, I have been trying to get my hands on electronic components, by either ordering from overseas or from local shops.
However, I've been facing difficulties in finding the right components, and sometimes the shops don't have them. Existing local websites are not user friendly and i often found myself buying incompatible components.

As a result, I am building a new web app where users will be able to find compatible pieces listed down below each component, or find fun projects to try. This will prevent beginners from being discouraged and attract more potential customers as well

Feature Description:
Users will be able to log in or register a new account
They will then be directed to a home page, split into a project and product section
The project section will have a list of fun projects that users can try, with a links to the required components
The product section will have a list of electronic components, with a list of compatible pieces below each component as well as projects in which they are featured
Users will be able to search and filter for products by name, category, or price
The user will be able to add components to a shopping cart, and checkout to pay for orders
Users will also be able to view their orders
There will also be an admin page where staff can alter the databases

Tech Stack : 
Front end : Html Css (Bootstrap) Javascript Django
Back end : Django
Database : postgres using neondb
